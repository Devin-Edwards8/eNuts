An online shop for delicious nuts.



## Overview
This is my first full-stack project, using MongoDB, React, Express and Node. I chose a mock eCommerce company selling one of my favorite foods: nuts.

### Shopping
The most critical feature, of course, is to be able to browse and purchase products. 
#### Features
- browse products in shop tab
- filter on ratings, price, type
- add to cart and checkout
#### Tech
- MongoDB Atlas used to store product info
- Express API provides endpoints for front-end
- React and CSS used to develop shopping UI

### Locations
The website also shows "locations" of our nut stores. 
#### Features
- view map display for each location
- easily browse multiple locations
#### Tech
- Google Maps Embed API used to generate location

## Future Development
As I work, I continue to find new, exciting features I want to add.

### Live Demo
Objective:
- allow website to be viewed by anyone

Learning Outcomes:
- host first backend site with AWS
- learn about network / infrastructure for web hosting

### Users
Objectives:
- save user information from session to session
- authenticate users with login functionality

Learning Outcomes:
